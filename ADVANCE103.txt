Working with excel conditional functions
___________________________________________ :

1. Working with excel name ranges. first we need to select the range of data , then chnage the name in the name box and then hit enter , this way we collectively give a name to that range of data then we can use that in any function of excel.(refsheet: if function , week 1). Disadvantage is that you will not get the column or the row reference. you can edit the name by going to formula tab and then name manager.

2. IF function:
go to formula tab and then to logical function select if.

3.Nesting function :
we can do the nesting using the AND logic function, we can nest AND inside IF.(CHECK IF FUNCTION SHEET)

4.COUNT IF:
This function basically returns the count of those data which satisfies the provided criteria.

5. SUM IF 

6.IFERROR(VALUE,VALUE_IF_ERROR)

7. VLOOKUP or VERTICAL LOOKUP ,
reference:Master employee list,vlookup function sheet
lookup value should always be in the first coloumn of the sheet.
                                                                                                   short cut for making absolute select and f4.
=VLOOKUP($B4,'Master Emp List'!$A$1:$I$38,2,FALSE) ($B4 is called as partial absolute).

8. Hlookup or horizontal lookup
reference:Master inventory list,hlookup function sheet

9.INDEX AND MATCH FUNCTIONS:
index and match functions are used beacuse the vlookup has some limitation , the value to search needs to be in the first column.

10. Index and Match combined:
=INDEX('INDEX MATCH Master Emp List'!$D$1:$D$38,MATCH(B4,'INDEX MATCH Master Emp List'!$A$1:$A$38,0)) perfect replacement for vlookup.

11. hlookup combined with match function , check sheet HLOOKUP Function .

12. left , right , mid function , these are text based functions.

13. search function (right to left trimming:=RIGHT($A2,LEN(A2)-SEARCH(" ",$A2)   ;   left to right trimming = =LEFT($A2,SEARCH(" ",$A2))

14.Concatenate function , this concats two or more words into one.

15. Auditing the formula , by tracing the precedent. using FORMULA section.

16. protecting a specific cell in a worksheet , if we hit only protect sheet it will protect the whole sheet , but we want some cells to remain unprotected then we have to unlock those cells , HOME->FONT->PROTECTION AND Uncheck the locked cells.

17. microsoft excel goal seek tools: DATA TAB-> what if analysis -> this function helps us to reach a goal and changed the cells related to the particular cell upon which the seek goal has been used.

18. solver tool (which is there for free but you will need to activate it , by bringing in the solver add in ) , solver tool can take multiple cells as constraint while solving , which gives it a advantage upon goal seek tool.

19. what if analysis , datatable 

20. Creating Scenarios in excel , with the help of scenario manager we can manage different scenarios in a single worksheet.(Data -> whatifanalysis -> scenario manager).

21. Learning Macros to automate repeatitive works , 
		1.Activating developers tab in the excel.(Right click on any of the tab above and then enable the developer option.
		2.Record Macros 
		3.creating button to run macros
22. Project 1 : Inserting and formatting text

23. you can use shapes predefined in the excel to behave as button for a particular marco , the benefit is you can fill the background of the shape with any color that you want.

24. You can add your macros in the quickacess tool bar.


25. how to load data to query editor and make change as per your wish.

___________________________________________________________POWER QUERY EDITOR______________________________________________________________________________
26. 	1.Import mode data storage uses the power bi's own memory.
	2.Another type of data storage mode is called as directquery , which is used when the dataset is too large and frequently changing.(Tables are 		directly connected to the source).
	3.Composite mode (dual) here the data is a mixture of both import mode storage and direct query .
	4. Connects to pre published power bi data set , in power bi services or power analysis service.

27.You can connect to a sql database , go to get data and then more options.give your server name and data base name and your credential , then you are good to go.

28. We also can extract data from the web , for that you need a url for that points to the data source .
	
29. Data Profiling tools such as coloumn quality(valid , error , empty) , coloumn distribution and column profile that allows you to explore the quality , composition and distribution of data before loading it into the BI front-end.(all these options are located in the view menu of the power query editor).

the coloumn profiling is done for first 1000 rows , so at the buttom of the screen left you change that value to entire rows.

we can analyze the errors by , hover > ... > keep error.

30.Text Tools: 1. Split a text coloumn based on a delimiter , specific character  2.Format a particular text 3.extract character from text.

Important ( You can access many tools from both the transform and add coloumn menu , the difference is that if you want add a new coloumn or overwrite an existing one ).

31. Numerical tools ( found in transform tab and add coloumn tab) : 1. Statistic ( it is useful to calculate basic stats for the selected coloumn like sum , mim max , average etc.)

32. date and time tool:

function it has date only(it remove the time component and leaves behind date only) , age(it gives the difference between the current date and the date in each row ) , earliest / latest (it evaluates the earliest and the latest date from a column), year / month / quater / week / day(it helps to extract individual component from a date field).

PRO TIP : LOAD UP A TABLE CONATAINING SINGLE DATE COLUMN AND USE DATE TOOLS TO BUILD OUT AN ENTIRE CALENDER TABLE.
start of the week, here you can determine the start of the week (1=monday , 2= tuesday and so on or you can write Day.Monday ).

CHANGE TYPE WITH LOACALE : it helps in clearing out all the error specific to location . for accessing it left click on the data type icon on the left side of the column header , towards the down you can find it.

PRO TIP : Go For rolling calendar ( choose a blank query > inside it write =#date(yyyy-mm-dd) write staring date of the current year) , then click on the formula icon , inside it[=List.Dates(
Source,
Number.From(DateTime.LocalNow())-Number.From(Source),
#duration(1,0,0,0)
)
]
 then finally convert it into a table.

33. Index columns(found in add column): it contains a list of sequential values that can be used to identify each unique row in a table.

Conditional columns (found in add column): it allows you to define new fields based on logical rules and condition. 

34. Grouping and aggregating : Group By(found in transform tab) allows you to aggregate at a different level or grain (i.e. group daily records into monthly). here you can group a specific data by choosing a specific coulumn to group.

35. Pivoting and unpivoting(found in transform tab): Pivot means converting rows into column and unpivot mean column into rows.(Transpose works in a similar manner but doesnt recognize unique values.)

36. Merging Queries: You can find merge queries in the home tab of the query editor,it allows you join two tables with respect to a column which is common in both the tables.(just because you can merge table its not necessary that you do so because , its better to make relationships between the table).

37. Append Queries: This concatenate two or more table by adding rows.Number of column should be same while appending.

PRO Tip: Appending files from a folder ( New Source > more > Folder) , even if in future you to add a data table , just put that data file inside the folder.

38. Data source setting. (whenever you move a source file from one folder to any other place or rename it , power bi gives u a data source error.)

39. Data Source parameter / Setting parameter

40. Refreshing Queries , we can also customize which queries are not to be refreshed .

41. you can import a fully built data model in excel into power bi 

________________________________________________________________CREATING DATA MODEL______________________________________________
1. Data Modeling 101 : when two or more table share relationship between them through an common field (product key).(created matrix visualization its just like pivot table in excel)

2. Data Normalization : It is the process of organizing tables and columns into relational database to reduce redundancy(duplicacy) and preserve data integrity.(or it means that one table should serve one distinct and specific purpose).  
ex-Model that arent normalized contains duplicate data , so all the product specific fields could be stored in a separate table containing a unique record for each product id.

3. Data models generally contain two types of table : FACT (data) tables , and DIMENSION (lookup) tables.
.fact tables contain numerical values or metrics udes for summarization (sales , order , transaction , pageviews , etc)
.Dimension tables contain descriptive attributes used for filtering or grouping.

4.Primary and Foriegn keys: foriegn keys(fact table) contain multiple instances of each value and relate to primary keys(dimension table) in dimension table.

5. Merging tables consume more memory , so avoid it.

6. Creating a relationship by dragging foriegn to primary key.

7. Managing/Editing relationships

8. Star and Snowflake Schemas.

9. There can only be only one active relationship between two tables , you have to deactivate one to activate other.

10. What is one to one , many to many , one to many ?(Relationship Cardianality)

11. Fact table should connect through shared dimensional table , not directly to each other.

12. Filter Context and flow: The direction of arrow shows the filter context , means suppose we have two fact table connected to a dimension table then it means the primary key holding dimensional table , is the only way to filter both fact table.(pro tip : through the direction of arrow we know though which key we need to filter).

13.BI-Direction filters .(Dont Use Bi - directional filter unless its very necessary).

14.Hiding fields from report view , for preventing users from choosing invalid fields.

15. Data format and catergory in data view.

16. creating data hierarchy.for eg: Country > state > region.

DAX
																				----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.There are 2 ways to use DAX 1. Calculated Columns 2. Measures

2. M code is used with the query editor where as DAX is used with front end and only applicable to those table which are part of the data model.

3. Calculated columns are used to filter out or to group the data rather than aggregating values. And calculated columns are always applied on the entire table or column. ex: Quantity Type = If('sales data'[order quantity] > 1 , "single" , "multiple")
4. Implicit measures are created when we drag a tables field into the visual value section.
5. Creating a dedicated table for measures , ex: Measure table (DAX) = {""} (it creates a table with single value).
6.Explicit Measure are created once , but can be referenced anywhere in the visuals.
